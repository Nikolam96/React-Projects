This is a collection of 13 exercises I found on the internet. While they are not large projects, each exercise React hooks, allowing me to gain experience in using the right hooks effectively and creating my own custom hooks. Additionally, I used libraries such as Toastify, React Icons, React Slick, and a third-party library for color generation to make better functionality of the projects.
